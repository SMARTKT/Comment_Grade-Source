void plptex3()

Prints out ""text"" at world cooordinate (wx,wy,wz).

The text is drawn parallel to the line between (wx,wy,wz) and
(wx+dx,wy+dy,wz+dz).

The text is sheared so that it is ""vertically"" parallel to the
line between (wx,wy,wz) and (wx+sx, wy+sy, wz+sz). If sx=sy=sz=0 then
the text is simply rotated to parallel to the baseline.

""just"" adjusts the horizontal justification of the string:
just = 0.0 => left hand edge of string is at (wx,wy)
just = 1.0 => right hand edge of string is at (wx,wy)
just = 0.5 => center of string is at (wx,wy) etc.

Calculations are done in physical coordinates.

! @file
!  This file contains routines to extract & process command flags.  The
!  command flags recognized by PLplot are stored in the ""ploption_table""
!  structure, along with strings giving the syntax, long help message, and
!  option handler.
!
!  The command line parser -- plparseopts() -- removes all recognized flags
!  (decreasing argc accordingly), so that invalid input may be readily
!  detected.  It can also be used to process user command line flags.  The
!  user can merge an option table of type PLOptionTable into the internal
!  option table info structure using plMergeOpts().  Or, the user can
!  specify that ONLY the external table(s) be parsed by calling
!  plClearOpts() before plMergeOpts().
!
!  The default action taken by plparseopts() is as follows:
!      - Returns with an error if an unrecognized option or badly formed
!        option-value pair are encountered.
!      - Returns immediately (return code 0) when the first non-option
!        command line argument is found.
!      - Returns with the return code of the option handler, if one
!        was called.
!      - Deletes command line arguments from argv list as they are found,
!        and decrements argc accordingly.
!      - Does not show ""invisible"" options in usage or help messages.
!      - Assumes the program name is contained in argv[0].
!
!  These behaviors may be controlled through the ""mode"" argument, which can
!  have the following bits set:
!
!  PL_PARSE_FULL -- Full parsing of command line and all error messages
!  enabled, including program exit when an error occurs.  Anything on the
!  command line that isn't recognized as a valid option or option argument
!  is flagged as an error.
!
!  PL_PARSE_QUIET -- Turns off all output except in the case of
!  errors.
!
!  PL_PARSE_NODELETE -- Turns off deletion of processed arguments.
!
!  PL_PARSE_SHOWALL -- Show invisible options
!
!  PL_PARSE_NOPROGRAM -- Specified if argv[0] is NOT a pointer to the
!  program name.
!
!  PL_PARSE_NODASH -- Set if leading dash is NOT required.
!
!  PL_PARSE_SKIP -- Set to quietly skip over any unrecognized args.
!
!  Note: if you want to have both your option and a PLplot option of the
!  same name processed (e.g. the -v option in plrender), do the following:
!      1. Tag your option with PL_OPT_NODELETE
!      2. Give it an option handler that uses a return code of 1.
!      3. Merge your option table in.
!  By merging your table, your option will be processed before the PLplot
!  one.  The PL_OPT_NODELETE ensures that the option string is not deleted
!  from the argv list, and the return code of 1 ensures that the parser
!  continues looking for it.
!
!  See plrender.c for examples of actual usage.

This draws a box around the current viewport, complete with axes,
ticks, numeric labels, and grids, according to input specification.

x0 and y0 specify the origin of the axes.

xopt and yopt are character strings which define the box as follows:

a: Draw axis (X is horizontal line Y=0, Y is vertical line X=0)
b: Draw bottom (X) or left (Y) frame of box
c: Draw top (X) or right (Y) frame of box
d: Interpret axis as a date/time when writing labels
f: Always use fixed point numeric labels
g: Draws a grid at the major tick interval
h: Draws a grid at the minor tick interval
i: Inverts tick marks
l: Logarithmic axes, major ticks at decades, minor ticks at units
n: Write numeric label at conventional location
m: Write numeric label at unconventional location
o: Label text is generated by a user-defined function
t: Draw major tick marks
s: Draw minor tick marks
u: like b (including all side effects such as tick marks and numerical
labels for those) except exclude drawing the edge.
w: like c (including all side effects such as tick marks and numerical
labels for those) except exclude drawing the edge.
v: (for Y only) Label vertically
x: like t (including the side effect of the numerical labels for the major
ticks) except exclude drawing the major and minor tick marks.

xtick, ytick are the major tick intervals required, zero for
automatic selection

plslabelfunc

Formats a PLFLT value in one of the following formats.

label_func - A pointer to a function which will provide a string to use
as the label for the given floating point value.
Pass this as NULL to clear the custom function and reset it to
the default PLplot labeling function.

label_data - Extra data to pass to the label function.

The label_func function arguments are, in order:

axis: PL_X_AXIS, PL_Y_AXIS or PL_Z_AXIS to indicate which axis is being
labeled
value: The value at this position on the axis
string: The resulting label string should be stored here
data: A pointer to whatever extra information the custom plotting function
requires

Eeeksss... this wasn't a nice bit of code to work out, let me tell you.
I could not work out an entirely satisfactory solution that made
logical sense, so came up with an ""illogical"" one as well.
The logical one works fine for text in the normal ""portrait""
orientation, and does so for reasons you might expect it to work; But
for all other orientations, the text's base line is either a little
high, or a little low. This is because of the way the base-line pos
is calculated from the decender height. The ""dodgie"" way of calculating
the position is to use the character height here, then adjust for the
decender height by a three-fold factor later on. That approach seems to
work a little better for rotated pages, but why it should be so, I
don't understand. You can compile in or out which way you want it by
defining ""DODGIE_DECENDER_HACK"".

note: the logic of the page rotation coming up next is that we pump in
the justification factor and then use freetype to rotate and transform
the values, which we then use to change the plotting location.

Writes the Hershey symbol ""ch"" centred at the physical coordinate (x,y).
This function is now just a ""spoof"" front end to the old plhersh,
which has now been renamed to plhrsh2(). All this function does is
decide whether or not we should render natively as unicode, and then
convert between hershey and unicode.

If the function KNOWS there isn't a unicode equivalent, then it will
try to render it as a hershey font. Understandably, this might make
testing out the unicode functions a little tricky, so if you want
to disable this behaviour, recompile with PL_TEST_FOR_MISSING_GLYPHS
defined.

Simple interface for defining viewport and window.

The ""just"" parameter control how the axes will be scaled:

just=-1 : The scales will not be set, the user must set up the scale
before calling plenv() using plsvpa(), plvasp() or other;
just= 0 : The scales will be set up to optimize plot area;
just= 1 : The scales will be the same;
just= 2 : The axes will be equal, the plot box will be square.

The ""axis"" parameter is interpreted as follows:

axis=-2 : draw no box, no tick marks, no numeric tick labels, no axes.
axis=-1 : draw box only.
axis= 0 : Draw box, ticks, and numeric tick labels.
axis= 1 : Also draw coordinate axes at X=0, and Y=0.
axis= 2 : Also draw a grid at major tick positions in both coordinates.
axis= 3 : Same as 2, but the grid will be also at the minor ticks.
axis=10 : Same as 0 except Logarithmic X tick marks. (The X data have
to be converted to logarithms separately.)
axis=11 : Same as 1 except Logarithmic X tick marks. (The X data have
to be converted to logarithms separately.)
axis=12 : Same as 2 except Logarithmic X tick marks. (The X data have

Formats a PLFLT value in one of the following formats.

label_func - A pointer to a function which will provide a string to use
as the label for the given floating point value.
Pass this as NULL to clear the custom function and reset it to
the default PLplot labeling function.

label_data - Extra data to pass to the label function.

The label_func function arguments are, in order:

axis: PL_X_AXIS, PL_Y_AXIS or PL_Z_AXIS to indicate which axis is being
labeled
value: The value at this position on the axis
string: The resulting label string should be stored here
data: A pointer to whatever extra information the custom plotting function
requires

PLINT sh_color, PLFLT sh_width, PLINT min_color, PLFLT min_width,
PLINT max_color, PLFLT max_width, void (*fill)(), PLINT
rectangular, ...)

arguments:

PLFLT &(a[0][0])

Contains array to be plotted. The array must have been declared as
PLFLT a[nx][ny].  See following note on fortran-style arrays.

PLINT nx, ny

Dimension of array ""a"".

char &(defined[0][0])

Contains array of flags, 1 = data is valid, 0 = data is not valid.
This array determines which sections of the data is to be plotted.
This argument can be NULL if all the values are valid.  Must have been
declared as char defined[nx][ny].

PLFLT xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax

Defines the ""grid"" coordinates.  The data a[0][0] has a position of
(xmin,ymin).

void (*mapform)()

Transformation from `grid' coordinates to world coordinates.  This
pointer to a function can be NULL in which case the grid coordinates
are the same as the world coordinates.

PLFLT shade_min, shade_max

Defines the interval to be shaded. If shade_max <= shade_min, plshade
does nothing.

PLINT sh_cmap, PLFLT sh_color, PLFLT sh_width

Defines color map, color map index, and width used by the fill pattern.

PLINT min_color, PLFLT min_width, PLINT max_color, PLFLT max_width

Defines pen color, width used by the boundary of shaded region. The min
values are used for the shade_min boundary, and the max values are used
on the shade_max boundary.  Set color and width to zero for no plotted
boundaries.

void (*fill)()

Routine used to fill the region.  Use plfill.  Future version of plplot
may have other fill routines.

PLINT rectangular

Flag. Set to 1 if rectangles map to rectangles after (*mapform)() else
set to zero. If rectangular is set to 1, plshade tries to save time by
filling large rectangles.  This optimization fails if (*mapform)()
distorts the shape of rectangles.  For example a plot in polor
coordinates has to have rectangular set to zero.

Example mapform's:

Grid to world coordinate transformation.
This example goes from a r-theta to x-y for a polar plot.

void mapform(PLINT n, PLFLT *x, PLFLT *y) {
int i;
double r, theta;
for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
r = x[i];
theta = y[i];
x[i] = r*cos(theta);
y[i] = r*sin(theta);
}
}

Grid was in cm, convert to world coordinates in inches.
Expands in x direction.

void mapform(PLINT n, PLFLT *x, PLFLT *y) {
int i;
for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
x[i] = (1.0 / 2.5) * x[i];
y[i] = (1.0 / 2.5) * y[i];
}

Does linear interpolation from doubly dimensioned coord arrays (column
dominant, as per normal C 2d arrays).

This routine includes lots of checks for out of bounds.  This would occur
occasionally due to some bugs in the contour plotter (now fixed).  If an
out of bounds coordinate is obtained, the boundary value is provided
along with a warning.  These checks should stay since no harm is done if
if everything works correctly.

plgriddata(): grids data from irregularly sampled data.

Real world data is frequently irregularly sampled, but most 3D plots
require regularly gridded data. This function does exactly this
using several methods:
Irregularly sampled data x[npts], y[npts], z[npts] is gridded into
zg[nptsx, nptsy] according to methode 'type' and grid information
xg[nptsx], yg[nptsy].

'type' can be:

GRID_CSA:    Bivariate Cubic Spline approximation (1)
GRID_NNIDW:  Nearest Neighbors Inverse Distance Weighted
GRID_NNLI:   Nearest Neighbors Linear Interpolation
GRID_NNAIDW: Nearest Neighbors Around Inverse Distance Weighted
GRID_DTLI:   Delaunay Triangulation Linear Interpolation (2)
GRID_NNI:    Natural Neighbors interpolation (2)

void plRotationShear

Calculates the rotation and shear angles from a plplot transformation matrix

N.B. the plot transformation matrix

[xFormMatrix[0] xFormMatrix[2]]
[xFormMatrix[1] xFormMatrix[3]]

is calculated as

[stride cos(t)    stride sin(t)]
[sin(p-t)              cos(p-t)]

where t is the rotation angle and p is the shear angle.
The purpose of this routine is to determine stride, rotation angle,
and shear angle from xFormMatrix.

For information only, xFormMatrix is the product of the following
rotation, skew(shear), and scale matrices:

[stride    0] [1      0] [cos(t)  sin(t)]
[0    cos(p)] [tan(p) 1] [-sin(t) cos(t)]

! Set color map 1 colors using a piece-wise linear relationship between
! position in the color map (from 0 to 1) and position in HLS or RGB color
! space.  May be called at any time.
!
! The idea here is to specify a number of control points that specify the
! mapping between HLS (or RGB or CMY) and palette 1 value.  Between these
! points, linear interpolation is used.  By mapping position in the color
! map to function value, this gives a smooth variation of color with
! intensity.  Any number of control points may be specified, located at
! arbitrary positions (intensities), although typically 2 - 4 are enough.
! Another way of stating this is that we are traversing a given number of
! lines through HLS (or RGB) space as we move through cmap 1 entries.  The
! control points at the minimum and maximum intensity (0 and 1) must
! always be specified.  By adding more control points you can get more
! variation.  One good technique for plotting functions that vary about
! some expected average is to use an additional 2 control points in the
! center (intensity ~= 0.5) that are the same color as the background
! (typically white for paper output, black for crt), and same hue as the
! boundary control points.  This allows the highs and lows to be very
! easily distinguished.
!
! Each control point must specify the position in cmap 1 as well as three
! coordinates in HLS or RGB space.  The first and last points MUST correspond to
! cmap1 coordinates MIN_PLFLT_CMAP1 and MAX_PLFLT_CMAP1.
!
! Every change in hue from one control point to the next can be linearly
! interpolated in two ways.  The usual (alt_hue_path[i] false) method for the ith interval
! uses the dh = h[i+1] - h[i] interval for interpolation.  The alternate (alt_hue_path true) method for the ith interval uses the dh = (h[i+1] - h[i]) - 360 if (h[i+1] - h[i]) is positive or dh = 360 - (h[i+1] - h[i]) if (h[i+1] - h[i]) is negative interval for the interpolation.  Thus, alt_hue_path true interpolation intervals always include hue = 0.
! Specifying
! alt_hue_path=NULL is equivalent to setting alt_hue_path[]=false for every control point.
!
! Bounds on RGB coordinates:
!	R,G,B		[0, 1]		magnitude
!
! Bounds on HLS coordinates:
!	hue		[0, 360]	degrees
!	lightness	[0, 1]		magnitude
!	saturation	[0, 1]		magnitude
!
! The inputs are:
! @param itype 0: HLS, 1: RGB

jc: I have checked, and both versions does give the same result, i.e., clipping
to the window boundaries. The reason is that the above plP_clip_poly() does
the clipping. To check this, is enough to diminish the x/y/z min/max arguments in

int circulation()

Returns the circulation direction for a given polyline: positive is
counterclockwise, negative is clockwise (right hand rule).

Used to get the circulation of the fill polygon around the bounding box,
when the fill polygon is larger than the bounding box.  Counts left
(positive) vs right (negative) hand turns using a cross product, instead of
performing all the expensive trig calculations needed to get this 100%
correct.  For the fill cases encountered in plplot, this treatment should
give the correct answer most of the time, by far.  When used with plshades,
the typical return value is 3 or -3, since 3 turns are necessary in order
to complete the fill region.  Only for really oddly shaped fill regions
will it give the wrong answer.

AM:
Changed the computation: use the outer product to compute the surface
area, the sign determines if the polygon is followed clockwise or
counterclockwise. This is more reliable. Floating-point numbers
are used to avoid overflow.

! PL_OPT_INVISIBLE	Make invisible (usually for debugging)
! PL_OPT_DISABLED	Ignore this option

Support routines for freetype font engine

This file contains a series of support routines for drivers interested
in using freetype rendered fonts instead of plplot plotter fonts.
Freetype supports a gerth of font formats including TrueType, OpenType,
Adobe Type1, Type42 etc... the list seems almost endless. Any bitmap
driver should be able to use any of these freetype fonts from plplot if
these routines are properly initialised.

Freetype support is not intended to be a ""feature"" of the common API,
but is  implemented as a driver-specific optional extra invoked via the
-drvopt command line toggle. It is intended to be used in the context of
""PLESC_HAS_TEXT"" for any bitmap drivers without native font support.
Implementing freetype in this manner minimise changes to the overall
API. Because of this approach, there is not a ""wealth"" of font options
available to the programmer. You can not do anything you can't do for a
normal freetype plotter font like boldface. You can do most of the
things that you can do with a plotter font however, like greek
characters superscripting, and selecting one of the four ""pre-defined""
plplot font types. At present underlining and overlining are not
supported.

To give the user some level of control over the fonts that are used,
environmental variables can be set to over-ride the definitions used by
the five default plplot fonts.

The exact syntax for evoking freetype fonts is dependant on each
driver, but for the GD and GNUSVGA drivers I have followed the syntax of
the PS driver and use the command-line switch of ""-drvopt text"" to
activate the feature, and suggest other programmers do the same for
commonality.

Both anti-aliased and monochrome font rendering is supported by these
routines. How these are evoked depends on the programmer, but with the
GD and GNUSVGA driver families I have used the command-line switch
""-drvopt smooth"" to activate the feature; but, considering you also need
to turn freetype on, it would probably really be more like ""-drvopt
text,smooth"".

void plpoly3( n, x, y, z, draw, ifcc )

Draws a polygon in 3 space.  This differs from plline3() in that
this attempts to determine if the polygon is viewable.  If the back
of polygon is facing the viewer, then it isn't drawn.  If this
isn't what you want, then use plline3 instead.

n specifies the number of points.  They are assumed to be in a
plane, and the directionality of the plane is determined from the
first three points.  Additional points do not /have/ to lie on the
plane defined by the first three, but if they do not, then the
determiniation of visibility obviously can't be 100% accurate...
So if you're 3 space polygons are too far from planar, consider
breaking them into smaller polygons.  ""3 points define a plane"" :-).

For ifcc == 1, the directionality of the polygon is determined by assuming
the points are laid out in counter-clockwise order.

For ifcc == 0, the directionality of the polygon is determined by assuming
the points are laid out in clockwise order.

BUGS:  If one of the first two segments is of zero length, or if
they are colinear, the calculation of visibility has a 50/50 chance
of being correct.  Avoid such situations :-).  See x18c for an
example of this problem.  (Search for ""20.1"").

void plpoly3( n, x, y, z, draw, ifcc )

Draws a polygon in 3 space.  This differs from plline3() in that
this attempts to determine if the polygon is viewable.  If the back
of polygon is facing the viewer, then it isn't drawn.  If this
isn't what you want, then use plline3 instead.

n specifies the number of points.  They are assumed to be in a
plane, and the directionality of the plane is determined from the
first three points.  Additional points do not /have/ to lie on the
plane defined by the first three, but if they do not, then the
determiniation of visibility obviously can't be 100% accurate...
So if you're 3 space polygons are too far from planar, consider
breaking them into smaller polygons.  ""3 points define a plane"" :-).

For ifcc == 1, the directionality of the polygon is determined by assuming
the points are laid out in counter-clockwise order.

For ifcc == 0, the directionality of the polygon is determined by assuming
the points are laid out in clockwise order.

BUGS:  If one of the first two segments is of zero length, or if
they are colinear, the calculation of visibility has a 50/50 chance
of being correct.  Avoid such situations :-).  See x18c for an
example of this problem.  (Search for ""20.1"").

void plfcont()

Draws a contour plot using the function evaluator f2eval and data stored
by way of the f2eval_data pointer.  This allows arbitrary organizations
of 2d array data to be used.

The subrange of indices used for contouring is kx to lx in the x
direction and from ky to ly in the y direction. The array of contour
levels is clevel(nlevel), and ""pltr"" is the name of a function which
transforms array indicies into world coordinates.

Note that the fortran-like minimum and maximum indices (kx, lx, ky, ly)
are translated into more C-like ones.  I've only kept them as they are
for the plfcont() argument list because of backward compatibility.

Function searches for in, the input hershey code, in a lookup table and
returns the corresponding index in that table.
Using this index you can work out the unicode equivalent as well as
the closest approximate to the font-face. If the returned index is
-1 then no match was possible.

Two versions of the function exist, a simple linear search version,
and a more complex, but significantly faster, binary search version.

linear search can be enabled by defining SIMPLE_BUT_SAFE_HERSHEY_LOOKUP

Now we have to try and componsate for the fact that the freetype glyphs are left

accurate because ""spacing"" is factored into the right hand side of the glyph,

rectangular, ...)

arguments:

PLFLT &(a[0][0])

Contains array to be plotted. The array must have been declared as
PLFLT a[nx][ny].  See following note on fortran-style arrays.

PLINT nx, ny

Dimension of array ""a"".

char &(defined[0][0])

Contains array of flags, 1 = data is valid, 0 = data is not valid.
This array determines which sections of the data is to be plotted.
This argument can be NULL if all the values are valid.  Must have been
declared as char defined[nx][ny].

PLFLT xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax

Defines the ""grid"" coordinates.  The data a[0][0] has a position of
(xmin,ymin).

void (*mapform)()

Transformation from `grid' coordinates to world coordinates.  This
pointer to a function can be NULL in which case the grid coordinates
are the same as the world coordinates.

PLFLT shade_min, shade_max

Defines the interval to be shaded. If shade_max <= shade_min, plshade
does nothing.

PLINT sh_cmap, PLFLT sh_color, PLFLT sh_width

Defines color map, color map index, and width used by the fill pattern.

PLINT min_color, PLFLT min_width, PLINT max_color, PLFLT max_width

Defines pen color, width used by the boundary of shaded region. The min
values are used for the shade_min boundary, and the max values are used
on the shade_max boundary.  Set color and width to zero for no plotted
boundaries.

void (*fill)()

Routine used to fill the region.  Use plfill.  Future version of plplot
may have other fill routines.

PLINT rectangular

Flag. Set to 1 if rectangles map to rectangles after (*mapform)() else
set to zero. If rectangular is set to 1, plshade tries to save time by
filling large rectangles.  This optimization fails if (*mapform)()
distorts the shape of rectangles.  For example a plot in polor
coordinates has to have rectangular set to zero.

Example mapform's:

Grid to world coordinate transformation.
This example goes from a r-theta to x-y for a polar plot.

void mapform(PLINT n, PLFLT *x, PLFLT *y) {
int i;
double r, theta;
for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
r = x[i];
theta = y[i];
x[i] = r*cos(theta);
y[i] = r*sin(theta);
}
}

Grid was in cm, convert to world coordinates in inches.
Expands in x direction.

void mapform(PLINT n, PLFLT *x, PLFLT *y) {
int i;
for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
x[i] = (1.0 / 2.5) * x[i];
y[i] = (1.0 / 2.5) * y[i];
}
}

void plform()

Formats a PLFLT value in one of the following formats.

If ll (logarithmic), then:

-	If lf (fixed), then used fixed point notation, i.e. .1, 1, 10, etc,
with unnecessary trailing .'s or 0's removed.

-	If !lf (default), then use exponential notation, i.e. 10^-1, etc.

If !ll (linear), then:

- If scale == 0, use fixed point format with ""prec"" places after the
decimal point.

-	If scale == 1, use scientific notation with one place before the
decimal point and ""prec"" places after.  In this case, the value
must be divided by 10^scale.

The axis argument is included to support PLplot's custom axis labeling.  It
is passed on to the custom labeling function if it exists.  Otherwise, it
is ignored.

Adjust for the descender - make sure the font is nice and centred
vertically. Freetype assumes we have a base-line, but plplot thinks of
centre-lines, so that's why we have to do this. Since this is one of our
own adjustments, rather than a freetype one, we have to run it through
the transform matrix manually.

For some odd reason, this works best if we triple the
descender's height and then adjust the height later on...
Don't ask me why, 'cause I don't know. But it does seem to work.

I really wish I knew *why* it worked better though...

int plhershey2unicode ( int in )

Function searches for in, the input hershey code, in a lookup table and
returns the corresponding index in that table.
Using this index you can work out the unicode equivalent as well as
the closest approximate to the font-face. If the returned index is
-1 then no match was possible.

Two versions of the function exist, a simple linear search version,
and a more complex, but significantly faster, binary search version.
If there seem to be problems with the binary search method, the brain-dead
linear search can be enabled by defining SIMPLE_BUT_SAFE_HERSHEY_LOOKUP

void plmtex3()

This is the 3d equivalent of plmtex(). It prints out ""text"" at specified
position relative to viewport (may be inside or outside)

side	String contains one or more of the following characters
x,y,z : Specify which axis is to be labeled
p,s   : Label the ""primary"" or the ""secondary"" axis. The ""primary"" axis
being somewhat arbitrary, but basically it is the one that you'd
expect to labeled in a 3d graph of standard orientation. Example:
for z this would be the left hand axis.
v     : draw the text perpendicular to the axis.

disp Displacement from specified edge of axis, measured outwards from
the axis in units of the current character height. The
centerlines of the characters are aligned with the specified
position.

pos	Position of the reference point of the string relative to the
axis ends, ranging from 0.0 (left-hand end) to 1.0 (right-hand
end)

just	Justification of string relative to reference point
just = 0.0 => left hand edge of string is at reference
just = 1.0 => right hand edge of string is at reference
just = 0.5 => center of string is at reference

All calculations are done in physical coordinates.

Follow polygon 1 (checking intersections with polygon 2 for each
segment of polygon 1) until you have accumulated two
intersections with polygon 2.  Here is an ascii-art illustration
of the situation.


2???2

""1"" marks polygon 1 vertices, ""2"" marks polygon 2 vertices, ""X""
marks the intersections, ""---"" stands for part of polygon 1
that has been previously searched for all possible intersections
from index 0, and ""..."" means polygon 1 continues
with more potential intersections above and/or below this diagram
before it finally hooks back to connect with the index 0 vertex.
""2???2"" stands for parts of polygon 2 that must connect with each other
(since the polygon 1 path between the two intersections is
known to be free of intersections.)

Polygon 2 is split at the boundary defined by the two
intersections and all (in this case three) polygon 1 vertices
between the two intersections for the next recursion level.  We
absolutely know for that boundary that no more intersections can
occur (both polygon 1 and polygon 2 are guaranteed not to
self-intersect) so we mark the status of those vertices with that
information so those polygon 2 split vertices will not be used to
search for further intersections at deeper recursion levels.
Note, we know nothing about whether the remaining ""2???2"" parts of the
split polygon 2 intersect with polygon 1 or not so those will
continued to be searched at deeper recursion levels. At the same
time, we absolutely know that the part of polygon 1 to the left of
rightmost x down to and including index 0 cannot yield more
intersections with any split of polygon 2 so we adjust the lower
limit of polygon 1 to be used for intersection searches at deeper
recursion levels.  The result should be that at sufficiently deep
recursion depth we always end up with the case that there are no
intersections to be found between polygon 1 and some polygon 2
split, and in that case we move on to the end phase below.

exfill()

Fills a polygon from points in x[] and y[] with all points in
undefined regions dropped and replaced by points at the bisected
edge of the defined region.
Note, undefined regions that are confined to the areas between polygon
points are completely ignored.  Also, a range of undefined polygon points
are simply replaced with a straight line with accurately bisected end
points.  So this routine can produce problematic plotted results
if the polygon is not a lot smaller than the typical resolution of
the defined region.

arguments are
idata: array containing image data
nx: dimension of the array in the X axis.
ny: dimension of the  array in the Y axis
The array data is indexed like data[ix][iy]

xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax:
data[0][0] corresponds to (xmin,ymin)
data[nx-1][ny-1] to (xmax,ymax)

zmin, zmax:
only data within bounds zmin <= data <= zmax will be
plotted. If zmin == zmax, all data will be ploted.

valuemin, valuemax:
The minimum and maximum values to use for value -> color
mappings.  A value in idata of valuemin or less will have
color 0.0 and a value in idata of valuemax or greater will
have color 1.0.  Values between valuemin and valuemax will
map linearly to to the colors between 0.0 and 1.0.
If you do not want to display values outside of the
(valuemin -> valuemax) range, then set zmin = valuemin and
zmax = valuemax.
This allows for multiple plots to use the same color scale
with a consistent value -> color mapping, regardless of the
image content.

Draws a contour plot using the function evaluator f2eval and data stored
by way of the f2eval_data pointer.  This allows arbitrary organizations
of 2d array data to be used.

The subrange of indices used for contouring is kx to lx in the x
direction and from ky to ly in the y direction. The array of contour
levels is clevel(nlevel), and ""pltr"" is the name of a function which
transforms array indicies into world coordinates.

Note that the fortran-like minimum and maximum indices (kx, lx, ky, ly)
are translated into more C-like ones.  I've only kept them as they are
for the plfcont() argument list because of backward compatibility.

Set up a window for three-dimensional plotting. The data are mapped
into a box with world coordinate size ""basex"" by ""basey"" by ""height"",
with the base being symmetrically positioned about zero. Thus
the mapping between data 3-d and world 3-d coordinates is given by:

x = xmin   =>   wx = -0.5*basex
x = xmax   =>   wx =  0.5*basex
y = ymin   =>   wy = -0.5*basey
y = ymax   =>   wy =  0.5*basey
z = zmin   =>   wz =  0.0
z = zmax   =>   wz =  height

The world coordinate box is then viewed from position ""alt""-""az"",
measured in degrees. For proper operation, 0 <= alt <= 90 degrees,
but az can be any value.

Next we load the char. This also draws the char, transforms it, and
converts it to a bitmap. At present this is a bit wasteful, but
if/when I add cache support, then this data won't go to waste.
Since there is no sense in going to the trouble of doing anti-aliasing
calculations since we aren't REALLY plotting anything, we will render
this as monochrome since it is probably marginally quicker. If/when
cache support is added, naturally this will have to change.

intensity of the reflected light in the surface from a light
source whose position is set using c_pllightsource()

or any bitwise combination, e.g. ""MAG_COLOR | SURF_CONT | BASE_CONT""

indexymin and indexymax are arrays which specify the y index range
(following the convention that the upper range limit is one more than
actual index limit) for an x index range of indexxmin, indexxmax.
This code is a complete departure from the approach taken in the old version
of this routine. Formerly to code attempted to use the logic for the hidden
line algorithm to draw the hidden surface. This was really hard. This code
below uses a simple back to front (painters) algorithm. All the
triangles are drawn.

There are multitude of ways this code could be optimized. Given the
problems with the old code, I tried to focus on clarity here.

plgriddata(): grids data from irregularly sampled data.

Real world data is frequently irregularly sampled, but most 3D plots
require regularly gridded data. This function does exactly this
using several methods:
Irregularly sampled data x[npts], y[npts], z[npts] is gridded into
zg[nptsx, nptsy] according to methode 'type' and grid information
xg[nptsx], yg[nptsy].

'type' can be:

GRID_CSA:    Bivariate Cubic Spline approximation (1)
GRID_NNIDW:  Nearest Neighbors Inverse Distance Weighted
GRID_NNLI:   Nearest Neighbors Linear Interpolation
GRID_NNAIDW: Nearest Neighbors Around Inverse Distance Weighted
GRID_DTLI:   Delaunay Triangulation Linear Interpolation (2)
GRID_NNI:    Natural Neighbors interpolation (2)

Adjust for the descender - make sure the font is nice and centred
vertically. Freetype assumes we have a base-line, but plplot thinks of
centre-lines, so that's why we have to do this. Since this is one of our
own adjustments, rather than a freetype one, we have to run it through
the transform matrix manually.

For some odd reason, this works best if we triple the
descender's height and then adjust the height later on...
Don't ask me why, 'cause I don't know. But it does seem to work.

I really wish I knew *why* it worked better though...

Writes the Hershey symbol ""ch"" centred at the physical coordinate (x,y).
This function is now just a ""spoof"" front end to the old plhersh,
which has now been renamed to plhrsh2(). All this function does is
decide whether or not we should render natively as unicode, and then
convert between hershey and unicode.

If the function KNOWS there isn't a unicode equivalent, then it will
try to render it as a hershey font. Understandably, this might make
testing out the unicode functions a little tricky, so if you want
to disable this behaviour, recompile with PL_TEST_FOR_MISSING_GLYPHS
defined.

arguments are
idata: array containing image data
nx: dimension of the array in the X axis.
ny: dimension of the  array in the Y axis
The array data is indexed like data[ix][iy]

xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax:
data[0][0] corresponds to (xmin,ymin)
data[nx-1][ny-1] to (xmax,ymax)

zmin, zmax:
only data within bounds zmin <= data <= zmax will be
plotted. If zmin == zmax, all data will be ploted.

valuemin, valuemax:
The minimum and maximum values to use for value -> color
mappings.  A value in idata of valuemin or less will have
color 0.0 and a value in idata of valuemax or greater will
have color 1.0.  Values between valuemin and valuemax will
map linearly to to the colors between 0.0 and 1.0.
If you do not want to display values outside of the
(valuemin -> valuemax) range, then set zmin = valuemin and
zmax = valuemax.
This allows for multiple plots to use the same color scale
with a consistent value -> color mapping, regardless of the
image content.

void plw3d()

Set up a window for three-dimensional plotting. The data are mapped
into a box with world coordinate size ""basex"" by ""basey"" by ""height"",
with the base being symmetrically positioned about zero. Thus
the mapping between data 3-d and world 3-d coordinates is given by:

x = xmin   =>   wx = -0.5*basex
x = xmax   =>   wx =  0.5*basex
y = ymin   =>   wy = -0.5*basey
y = ymax   =>   wy =  0.5*basey
z = zmin   =>   wz =  0.0
z = zmax   =>   wz =  height

The world coordinate box is then viewed from position ""alt""-""az"",
measured in degrees. For proper operation, 0 <= alt <= 90 degrees,
but az can be any value.

c: Draw top (X) or right (Y) frame of box
d: Interpret axis as a date/time when writing labels
f: Always use fixed point numeric labels
g: Draws a grid at the major tick interval
h: Draws a grid at the minor tick interval
i: Inverts tick marks
l: Logarithmic axes, major ticks at decades, minor ticks at units
n: Write numeric label at conventional location
m: Write numeric label at unconventional location
o: Label text is generated by a user-defined function
t: Draw major tick marks
s: Draw minor tick marks
u: like b (including all side effects such as tick marks and numerical
labels for those) except exclude drawing the edge.
w: like c (including all side effects such as tick marks and numerical
labels for those) except exclude drawing the edge.
v: (for Y only) Label vertically
x: like t (including the side effect of the numerical labels for the major

Shade region -- this routine does all the work

This routine is internal so the arguments can and will change.
To retain some compatibility between versions, you must go through
some stub routine!

parameters:

f2eval, f2eval_data:  data to plot
defined: defined mask (old API - implimented)
nx, ny: array dimensions
xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax: grid coordinates
shade_min, shade_max: shade region with values between ...
sh_cmap, sh_color, sh_width: shading parameters, width is only for hatching
min_color, min_width: line parameters for boundary (minimum)
max_color, max_width: line parameters for boundary (maximum)
set min_width == 0 and max_width == 0 for no contours
fill: fill function, set to NULL for no shading (contour plot)
rectangular: flag set to 1 if pltr() maps rectangles to rectangles
this helps optimize the plotting
pltr: function to map from grid to plot coordinates

It is used here and farther below when computing the vertical

now, the text produced with Hershey fonts was systematically taller
than the same text produced with TT fonts, and tha by a factor of
around 1.125 (I discovered this empirically).  This corresponds
roughly to the ratio between total height and the ascender of some

arguments are
idata: array containing image data
nx: dimension of the array in the X axis.
ny: dimension of the  array in the Y axis
The array data is indexed like data[ix][iy]

xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax:
data[0][0] corresponds to (xmin,ymin)
data[nx-1][ny-1] to (xmax,ymax)

zmin, zmax:
only data within bounds zmin <= data <= zmax will be
plotted. If zmin == zmax, all data will be ploted.

valuemin, valuemax:
The minimum and maximum values to use for value -> color
mappings.  A value in idata of valuemin or less will have
color 0.0 and a value in idata of valuemax or greater will
have color 1.0.  Values between valuemin and valuemax will
map linearly to to the colors between 0.0 and 1.0.
If you do not want to display values outside of the
(valuemin -> valuemax) range, then set zmin = valuemin and
zmax = valuemax.
This allows for multiple plots to use the same color scale
with a consistent value -> color mapping, regardless of the
image content.

and which have no duplicate vertices or two consecutive edges that
are parallel.  A further requirement is that both polygons have a
positive orientation (see
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve_orientation).  That is, as you
traverse the boundary in index order, the inside area of the
polygon is always on the left.  Finally, the first vertex of
polygon 1 (starting with n1 -1) that is not near the border of
polygon 2 must be outside polygon 2.  N.B. it is the calling
routine's responsibility to insure all those requirements are
satisfied.

Two polygons that do not self intersect must have an even number of
edge crossings between them.  (ignoring vertex intersections which
touch, but do not cross).  fill_intersection_polygon eliminates
those intersection crossings by recursion (calling the same routine
twice again with the second polygon split at a boundary defined by
the first intersection point, all polygon 1 vertices between the
intersections, and the second intersection point).  Once the
recursion has eliminated all crossing edges, fill or not using the

Draw the next view of a 3-d plot. The physical coordinates of the
points for the next view are placed in the n points of arrays u and
v. The silhouette found so far is stored in the heap as a set of m peak
points.

These routines dynamically allocate memory for hidden line removal.
Memory is allocated in blocks of 2*BINC*sizeof(PLINT) bytes.  Large
values of BINC give better performance but also allocate more memory
than is needed. If your 3D plots are very ""spiky"" or you are working
with very large matrices then you will probably want to increase BINC.
