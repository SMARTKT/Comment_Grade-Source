spiral.c
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
This program will generate a given number of spiral points uniformly 
distributed on the surface of a sphere. The number of points is given on 
the command line as the first parameter.  Thus `spiral 100' will generate
100 points on the surface of a sphere, and output them to stdout.
        A number of different command-line flags are provided to set the
radius of the sphere, control the output format, or generate points on
an ellipsoid.  The definition of the flags is printed if the program is
run without arguments: `spiral'.
        The idea behind the algorithm is that one can cut the globe with 
N horizontal planes spaced 2/(N-1) units apart, forming N circles of 
latitude on the sphere, each latitude containing one spiral point.  To
obtain the kth spiral point, one proceeds upward from the (k-1)st point
(theta(k-1), phi(k-1)) along a great circle to the next latitude and 
travels counterclockwise along ti for a fixed distance to arrive at the 
kth point (theta(k), phi(k)).
        The default output is integers, rounded from the floating point
computation.  The rounding implies that some points will fall outside
the sphere, and some inside.  If all are required to be inside, then
the calls to irint() should be removed.
        The flags -a, -b, -c are used to set ellipsoid axis lengths.
Note that the points are not uniformly distributed on the ellipsoid: they
are uniformly distributed on the sphere and that is scaled to an ellipsoid.
        random() is used to generate random numbers, seeded with time().

cube.c
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
This program will generate a given number of points uniformly distributed
inside a cube. The number of points is given on the command line as the 
first parameter.  Thus `cube 100' will generate 100 points in a cube,
and output them to stdout.
	A number of different command-line flags are provided to set the 
side-length of the cube, control the output format, or to change the cube
to a box. The definition of the flags is printed if the program is 
run without arguments: `cube'.  Note that -s sets the half-side
length: points are generated between -s and +s.
        The default output is integers, rounded from the floating point
computation.  The rounding implies that some points will fall outside
the sphere, and some inside.  If all are required to be inside, then
the calls to irint() should be removed.
	The flags -a, -b, -c are used to set different x, y, z side-lengths 
for a box.  Note that the points are not uniformly distributed: they are 
uniformly distributed on the cube and then scaled.
	random() is used to generate random numbers, seeded with time().
How to compile:
	gcc -o cube cube.c -lm

sphere.c
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
This program will generate a given number of points uniformly distributed
on the surface of a sphere. The number of points is given on the command
line as the first parameter.  Thus `sphere 100' will generate 100 points 
on the surface of a sphere, and output them to stdout.
	A number of different command-line flags are provided to set the 
radius of the sphere, control the output format, or generate points on 
an ellipsoid.  The definition of the flags is printed if the program is 
run without arguments: `sphere'.
	The idea behind the algorithm is that for a sphere of radius r, the 
area of a zone of width h is always 2*pi*r*h, regardless of where the sphere 
is sliced.  The implication is that the z-coordinates of random points on a 
sphere are uniformly distributed, so that x and y can always be generated by 
a given z and a given angle.
	The default output is integers, rounded from the floating point 
computation.  The rounding implies that some points will fall outside
the sphere, and some inside.  If all are required to be inside, then
the calls to irint() should be removed.  
	The flags -a, -b, -c are used to set ellipsoid axis lengths.  
Note that the points are not uniformly distributed on the ellipsoid: they 
are uniformly distributed on the sphere and that is scaled to an ellipsoid.
	random() is used to generate random numbers, seeded with time().
How to compile:
